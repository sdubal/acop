libipfix 1.0

This package contains source code for a library to export and 
collect IPFIX measurement and accounting data. 
The library is complemented with an IPFIX collector and
a basic IPFIX probe.

The library supports IPFIX (draft-ietf-ipfix-protocol-24.txt,
draft-ietf-ipfix-info-15.txt, draft-ietf-psamp-info-05.txt)
and Netflow9 (RFC 3954) using TCP, UDP and SCTP as transport protocol.

There are some small example programs containing code that 
demonstrates how to use the library.
